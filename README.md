# webProject
this was the academic project of 3-1. This showcases a sweetshop website, where basic laravel was used with mySQL database for CRUD operations. People can see the items, can add them to cart, can go forward to buy them, change their order. but payment method was not included. sweet-tooth people can also share their own recipe in here.

## how to run
